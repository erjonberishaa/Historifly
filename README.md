### üåç Explore history through gaming with 'Historifly'

My first Unity Project, using C#. Inspired by Angry Birds, it takes gameplay to new heights by blending fun with education. Featuring four captivating levels, each delving into historical tales from Egyptian adventures to the Roman Empire. Excited about future developments and the chance to add more historical richness to this project!
